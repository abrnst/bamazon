Here is the start of the app. Bamazon will show you a unique ID for each item, name of the item, department of the item, and how much we have in stock. Bamazon will ask the user with id does the user want to buy.

Next Bamazon will ask you how much of the item would you like to buy. Please be sure to buy not more than what we have in stock.  If you try to buy more, Bamazon will ask you to try again.
